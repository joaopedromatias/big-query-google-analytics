# üîé Query Google Analytics Data in Big Query

This is a NodeJS project that runs 10 queries against a public Google Analytics database üìä

The `goal` is to answer some business questions in order to optimize decision making üéØ

## Transactions üí∞

### 1. What was the revenue for each product? 

```sql
SELECT
  p.V2ProductName as product_name,
  ROUND(SUM(p.productRevenue) / 1000000, 2) as product_revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017041*`,
  UNNEST(hits) AS h,
  UNNEST(h.product) AS p
  GROUP BY product_name
  ORDER BY product_revenue DESC
  LIMIT 10
```

PS: in order for it to work on your computer, you need to insert a valid service account credentials path and your Google Cloud Platform project id into the `.env` file. You can also authenticate using your own login by running `gcloud auth application-default login` (need to have the gcloud SDK installed on the machine and turn on the Big Query API on your Google Cloud Platform project).
